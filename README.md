# bikesharing

## Overview
This project analyzed bikesharing data from NYC in the month of August to examine trends of bike rentals. This was done by cleaning the data in Python and analyzing and presenting the data with Tableau Public. ![Check out the Tableau Public story here!](https://public.tableau.com/views/Module14_16383176292380/Story1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Results
This included total rides, start and end date/times, gender of riders, station information including names and latitudes and longitudes, as well as user type (those who were bike rental subscribers and those who were not). The time data was cleaned in Python to make it into a format that was usable by Tableau. 
The results show that major metropolitan areas had higher traffic, and that those who identified as male were more likly to use the bikes and to subcribe to the bike rentals than those who identified as females or did not disclose or identify a gender. Trips tended to occur over the weekend afternoons and at times commonly associated with work traffic (7-8am and 5-6pm). 

## Summary 
### Checkout Times for Users
* There appears to be a clear distinction in the amount of time that bikes are rented for, with rides lasting longer than 40 minutes reaching 0.

### Checkout Times for Users
* The trend in rides 40 minutes or shorter remains, even when separating out gender identity. However, this does show that there are more males renting the bikes than other gender identies.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
* This heat map shows the rental trends over the period of a week. Rides appear to be consistant with most typical work starting and ending times, suggesting that bike rentals may be often used for work transportation. Additionally, weekend afternoons have consistant usage as well.

### Time of Trips by Gender 
* This heatmap shows the same trends, separated by gender identity. In general, the trends are consistant with previous findings that males were more likely to use the bikes, but the times for use appear to be consistant over gender.

## User Trips by Gender and User Type
* This chart shows that in general, males were much more likely to be bike subscribers than other gender identities. Those who did not subscribe, appear to have much closer trends, regardless of gender. This suggests that the target demographic for rental bikes should be males, followed by females, who subscribe to the rental service.

## Starting and Ending Locations
* The following maps show the starting and ending locations for the bikes. In general, these appear to be mostly focused on metropolitan areas.

### Additional Questions
Future research could examine the locations of starting and stopping locations based on weekday, to determine if certain areas may be more popular during the weekend vs. weekday. This could also assist in understanding user trends. Additionally, future research could examine the subscribers by birth year. Year of user birth could assist in targeting marketing campaigns most focused on the highest use demographic.
